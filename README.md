# challengeAcceptedAndroidApp
This was required for our 3rd year Android Development assignment. 'Challenge Accepted' is a game application which is based around players daring each other to send 'risky' SMS messages (written by other players and partially obscured from the 'dared' player) to a contact in the player's phone book,at random.  The riskier the SMS message, the higher the points awarded.
